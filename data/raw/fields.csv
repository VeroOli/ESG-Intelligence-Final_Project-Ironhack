- Clean power and energy: Including renewable energy, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS), energy efficiency, energy storage, hydrogen, nuclear energy, electricity transmission and distribution, electricity marketing and trading, and smart grid (where applicable).
- Electrified transport: Focused on passenger and light commercial vehicles. Including electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facilities, EV charging equipment and services.

BNEF calculates the estimated exposure using BICS (Bloomberg Industry Classification Standard) segmented revenues as the preferred metric. Where applicable, additional datasets are used as revenue proxies to improve the quality of estimates. These include asset-level data from BNEF, revenues by measure and geography from company reports, and a breakdown of clean energy generation and capacity.

The estimated clean energy exposure rating is presented as one of the following:
- A1 Main Driver (50-100%)
- A2 Considerable (25-49%)
- A3 Moderate (10-24%)
- A4 Minor (<10%)

The Issue Disclosure Factor is only applied at the Issue Score level.

The Issue Disclosure Factor scales and shifts the Issue Performance Score into a disclosure-driven range, bounded by the Lower Target and Upper Target. For instance a zero quantitative disclosure results in Performance Scores being adjusted to a 0-3 range. There is a disclosure-incentive Issue Score boost for all but the lowest Performance Scores (everything above 1.5).

Issue Score (ST024, SUSTAINABLE_FINANCE_ISSUE_SCORE) aggregates the Issue Performance Score and Issue Disclosure Factor, where:

X6979,2030_RENEW_SHARE_TARGET_CTRY_RSK,2030 Renewable Generation Target (Country of Risk),"Target for the renewable share of power generation that a country or region needs to achieve in 2030 to be on track for net-zero in 2050. Relates to the security's country of risk, not the security itself. The estimate is based on country modelling, if available, or alternatively on regional modelling. The number represents a percentage and ranges from 0 to 100.
